I once tried output data to RPT documents and transferred to others, but it’ll spend myself too much time.\nAnd I also tried to write some scripts to coworkers, let them run this scripts on sqlserver studio. But it was hard to them. They are just accountants.\nSo I decided to build a web server.\nTo build a web server is not difficult as you thought. I spend just two days to this. I downloaded XAMPP and installed it. There are many instructions to follow, so please don’t fear about it. There are many templates that we can used to design php websites.

As you know, many tasks are very similar in our work and we must do them again and again just because some data is changed. It will spend our much time and it’s very boring. But if you have R, you can do this easily. NEXT, I will share what I do with R.\nThere are two important things for analysis. One is data, another is analytic process.\nHere are some analytical steps:\nBuild a database Make a script to download data and import to database Find a proposal and make a R script Run the R script at R-studio Upon steps are the basic method to get a digraph.\nBesides that, you also need to get these knowledge. These are lists:\nDatabase knowledge, it’ll help you to get data R packages knowledge, it’ll help you to form figure Finally, it’s better if you take some tips about RMD for html.
