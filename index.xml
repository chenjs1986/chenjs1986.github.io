      <description>I used two main database. One is Mysql,anther is Sqlserver.
Early, Mysql is the best choice for me. It&amp;rsquo;s handy and friendly. A financial personal database were builded by it. I downloaded data from CS/BS client and import it into Mysql.
Then I wrote many sql-language script to get many statements or reports quickly. It&amp;rsquo;s saving much of time for me.
Now,I use sqlserver to manage huge data because of Mysql support huge data poorly.</description>

      <description>R is a very famous programming language. R was designed by statisticians who want analysis to be easy.
We can use R to analyze data or formal digraph. I usually take some graph by R. As you know, many tasks are very similar in our work and we must do them again and again just because some data is changed. It will spend our much time and itâ€™s very boring. But if you have R, you can do this easily.</description>
